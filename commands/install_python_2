#
# Set up a basic install of Python 2 (2.7.12, specifically), complete with setuptools, pip, and virtualenv
# (Why would anyone want Python without setuptools, pip, and virtualenv?)
#
# This script builds Python without the following libraries; in the future, we should probably add them in:
# - Tcl/Tk
# - _bsddb
# - _curses
# - _curses_panel
# - _tkinter
# - bsddb185
# - dbm
# - dl
# - gdbm
# - imageop
# - readline
# - sunaudiodev

# Install the CentOS development tools, if we don't already have it;
# these are needed so that we can compile Python from source
sudo yum groupinstall -y 'development tools'

# If you want to be able to do 'import ____' and for it to work, you
# better have these packages on your system before you compile Python
sudo yum install -y zlib-dev openssl-devel sqlite-devel bzip2-devel

# Python has to be a special snowflake and compress its source with .xz,
# so we install a package to unzip those kinds of files
sudo yum install -y xz-libs

# We're going to download and compile in a new /tmp/install_python_2 directory
mkdir /tmp/install_python_2
cd /tmp/install_python_2

# Download the Python 2.7.12 source
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/Python-2.7.12.tar.xz

# "Unzip" the Python source
xz -d Python-2.7.12.tar.xz
tar -xvf Python-2.7.12.tar

# Configure, build, and install Python
cd /tmp/install_python_2/Python-2.7.12
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make altinstall
cd /tmp/install_python_2

# Install setuptools
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | sudo /usr/local/bin/python2.7

# Install pip
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo /usr/local/bin/python2.7

# Install virtualenv
sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install virtualenv

# Create a directory for virtualenv's to live in
sudo mkdir /opt/virtualenvs
sudo chown centos:centos /opt/virtualenvs

# Clean up the /tmp/install_python_2 folder since we're done with it
rm -rf /tmp/install_python_2
